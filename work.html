                    <p>Most recently I was working with an agency called Four Marketing based in Old Street, East London. They are the UK distributors for brands such as Stone Island, CP Company, Napapijri...and many others.
                      I was Operations Manager and linked together multiple parts of the business. One of the perks of the job was travelling to meet customers including Selfridges and Harrods as well as independents around the country (over 100 stores). </p>

                <div class="about">
                <p> When I moved to London in 2012 I started working at a British menswear brand called Albam. Before long I was their Retail Operatins manager and managed a team of around 30 people and 5 locations. 
                    I met many many friends at Albam and really thrived in the creative environment of an independent business. My time here came to an end as we grew the business to focus more on International wholesale rather than brick and mortar retail.
