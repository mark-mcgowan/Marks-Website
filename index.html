            Hi! My name is Mark. I love design, photography and learning about programming!
            <br>

            Currently I am studying with Codenation and just about to finish their 3 week course. It's been a thoroughly enjoyable experience learning about Python in week 1,
             completing a group project in week two and now working on a personal website for week 3. For this project I had hoped to make something far more advanced than this 
             but my somewhat novice skill level has become apparent!
           <br>
       
        <br>Prior to the Codenation course I was based in London and working in the fashion industry. During an exciting 7+ years I helped run a British based brand called 
        Albam and more recently was overseeing retail operations for an agency called Four Marketing where I worked with brands like Stone Island, CP Company, Paul and Shark
         and Napapijri. The fashion industry is a fast paced and exciting one with plenty of travel and expensed dinners but I now want to follow a longstanding interest and learn 
         web dev.
